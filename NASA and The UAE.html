<h3> <font color= white> NASA or The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is America’s space program and is the global leader of space exploration. They are responsible for science and technology related to air and space. NASA also works on different projects with different countries 
to enhance exploration in space for humans and robots. They are also responsible for the ISS (International Space Station). At their facilities they study Earth, its climate, our Sun, and our solar system and beyond! They are conducting research,
 testing and developing things to advance aeronautics, including electric propulsion and supersonic flight. They develop and fund space technologies that will help in future exploration and benefit life on Earth. NASA also leads a Moon to Mars exploration approach, 
which includes working with US industry, international partners and academia to develop new technology, and send research and soon humans to explore the moon on different missions that will help prepare for human exploration on Mars (The Red Planet). Besides that, 
companies use NASA discoveries and technologies to create products for ordinary people like you and me. So, they can ensure success for the agency and the world, NASA also supports education efforts in STEM to increase future workforce. </h3> </font color>

<h3> <font color= white> Artemis Accords- The UAE Space Agency signed the mission with NASA in October 2020 and is working towards realizing its long-term Moon exploration ambitions. 
Its goals include developing and launching a number of rover and orbiter to the Moon and send an Emirati to the surface. “The UAE can, and hope we will, become a strong and robust partner in the Artemis program,” said Mr. Gold, 
talking about a project to make a human base on the Moon. “We look forward to collaborating not only on lunar rovers, but on other forms of science and orbiters, and eventually human spaceflight as well.” </h3> </font color>

<td> The Hubble Space Telescope is a large telescope in space. It was launched into orbit by a space shuttle. Scientists have used it to observe distant stars and galaxies as well as the planets in our solar system. It was launched in April 1990 making the most significant advancement in astronomy besides Galileo’s telescope. </td>

<td> The Spitzer Space Telescope launched in launched in 2003 was NASA’s Infrared observatory. It discovered a giant ring of Saturn, revealed a system of 7 earth-size planets around a star 40 light years away! </td>

<td> The ISS is the international space station which provides a location for long duration missions and training in a low orbit. It is also sent to test shuttles and different space inventions. </td>

<td> This program was to give the US a valuable experience in operating a space station for long periods of time. They gained valuable experience in operating spacewalks and many other things. </td>

<h3> <mark> NASA has done many things for the benefit of mankind here are some examples: </mark> </h3>

<h3> <font color=white> <p> <u> Artificial Limbs- </u> NASA had originally designed these for space vehicles but hey make artificial human limbs which are more functionable, durable, comfortable and life-like. </h3> </font color> </p>

<h3> <font color=white> <p> <u> Scratch-resistant lenses- </u> After NASA developed scratch resistant astronaut helmets the agency continues experimenting with scratch-resistant plastics which now compromise of scratch resistant shades and lenses. </h3> </font color> </p>

<h3> <font color=white> <p> <u> LASIK- </u> Technology used to track astronauts' eyes during periods in space in order to assess how humans' frames of reference are affected by weightlessness has become essential for use during LASIK surgery. The device tracks a patient's eye positions for the surgeon. </h3> </font color> </p>

<h3> <font color=white> <p> <u> Water Filtration- </u> In the 1970s, NASA developed filtration systems that used iodine and cartridge filters to ensure that astronauts had access to safe, tasteless water. This filtering technology is now very common. </h3> </font color> </p>

<h3> <font color=white> <p> <u> 3D Food Printing- </u> The ability to cook food on long space missions is no longer impossible with the invention of 3D food printers! This technology is now being unfortunately for commercial use for the production of chocolates and other confections as well as to create nutritious foods for diabetics and others with specific needs. </h3> </font color=white> </p>

<h3> <font color= white> NASA has helped in globalization by having a news channel and website which spreads information to the world about their projects, motives and plans which includes the whole world. NASA is also partnering with other countries to do further space exploration missions so the whole world is helping and involved hence globalization. NASA stated that they will try to cooperate with the international community in our world. They look forward to working with international partners to strengthen peaceful international space cooperation for the benefit of humankind. </h3> </font color= white>

<h3> <font color= white> NASA has been trying to achieve long term sustainability goals for many years through numerous efforts in energy conversation, 
recycling, water management, pollution, design and construction, maintenance and operations, master planning and electronic stewardship. 
They also will operate and maintain its building in a way that reduces energy, water and material consumption. Which will achieve a 
reduction in OM cost so their buildings are more sustainable. Sustainability has also been addressed by NASA as they are a global leader in 
studying Earth’s changing climate. They observe Earth from space, air and on the ground which is helping us humans learn how the stems interact 
with each other to improve sustainability. This is because they are experts in climate and Earth science even though their role is not to make a 
solution to climate change and sustainability they are! They provide the scientific data needed to understand climate change. 
They also are trying to improve air quality by using their broadcasts and forecasters to get accurate data and warnings. </h3> </font color= white>

<h3> <font color= white> NASA has made serious investments in climate change research and technology which has nearly $810 million in revenue. They have also generated more than $64.3 billion in total economic output, supported more than 312,000 jobs nationwide and estimated $7 billion in federal, state and local tax revues! NASA also uses space technology which combats poverty by helping developing countries gather and monitor data to make the most informed decisions. With the help of satellites, governments can locate vulnerable areas and direct aid to the people in need. </h3> </font color= white>

<td> The infrared sensors were developed by NASA for the measurements of the temperature of distant celestial objects. This technology led to the development of optical sensor thermometers which have provided us with body temperature readings when placed inside our ear canals. </td>

<td> NASA engineers built a humanoid robot called Valkyrie or Robonaut 5 (R5) to help in a crewed mission to Mars or the Moon. R5 could assemble equipment before astronauts arrive and do maintenance or repairs after the crew arrives. R5 was initially designed to complete disaster-relief maneuvers. However, its main goal is to prove itself worthy of even trickier terrain- deep space exploration. This robot might just make breakthroughs in humanoid control, motion planning and perception. This robot also cost $2 million and hopefully this robot will help us humans colonize Mars. </td>
